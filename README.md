# EmailScheduler
EmailScheduler is a webapp that is used to schedule emails to be sent to someone in the future. It was built using javascript, HTML andd CSS as the frontend and Java Spring as the backend.

Here I used Postman to give what was required in order to schedule the email

The user can also fill out a form and an email will be scheduled for them too
